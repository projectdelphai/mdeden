Todo
------------
0.0.5 will mainly be about optimizing and cleaning up a lot of the codebase. So far there hasn't been a lot of bugs and so I'm going to start working on making it work a little faster, removing unnecessary functions, some error-catching, and removing any unnecessary dependencies. It will probably include the ability to set the chapter of a manga and interactive actions with the database. Here will appear the command line functions.

A gem is slowly coming out that deals with a lot of what I've learned by making this program. It's already up, but work won't fully start until after 0.0.5
